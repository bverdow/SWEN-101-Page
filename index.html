            I went to a very small highschool, called Fabius-Pompey, located about 30 minutes south of Syracuse, New York.
            I like to play video games, play soccer, and play golf. I love to travel and go to restaurants and eat good food,
            especially Miami where I have two uncles. I have two brothers, one of which has graudated as a 
            Software Engineer from RIT, and one who is currently in his fifth year as a Software Engineer at RIT.
